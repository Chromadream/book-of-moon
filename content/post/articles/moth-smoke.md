***"Once we were eating mangoes, the three of us together. I said Sindhris are my favourite. Daru said, You can't juice Sindhri, only cut them. He said, Chaunsas are my favourite because they're the best for sucking. She said, I like Anwar Ratores, because they're small and you can have two or three at a time."***

## Mangoes.

The fact that this book mentions mangoes and all its eligible pure breeds is a testament to its Pakistani-ness. Never abuse mangoes in front of a Pakistani; you will be clubbed. It's our fruit, it's our food, it's our legal lust--tasted by lips of the spoilt elite to the lowlifes of backstreets. There is not a born Pakistani on Earth who does not admire mangoes to a degree of infinity and there is not a more qualified bunch of mangoes that you'll find elsewhere in the world.

Personally, I prefer Chaunsas myself.

Moth Smoke was, at once, a brilliant as well as a disheartening read. It tells us the story of a man called Darashikoh (mercifully shortened to Daru) and the ultimate debilitation life leads him into. It also tells us of his love, Mumtaz, and her husband, Aurangzeb, who happens to be Daru's best friend.

## Lahore.

Like most fictitious dramas, Moth Smoke was driven by its characters, much less the story. We begin with Daru and his position in the global community. The setting is the city of Lahore. The novel is more of a monologue coming from Daru and explaining the tumult of feelings whirling inside him with every step he takes into a fate of destruction. While being quite the intriguing and smart character, he was by no means a likable one. I was conflicted about Daru from the beginning till the end. However, every act that the man performed was bound to a need that the reader slowly learns over the course of the book.

Mumtaz was, perhaps, my most admired character by far. This lady is everything a lady should be and should not be, simultaneously.

***"I'm interested in things women do that aren't spoken about."***

Mumtaz's history was disconcerting and engaging to read. Many women will not be able to sympathize with her. Deeming herself an unworthy mother and torn between her husband and his best friend, Mumtaz's conflicted mind leads her into a desperate state of ill psychology and self-destruction that she also unknowingly bestows upon her illicit lover.

## Shift in Views.

The book often broke the fourth wall to directly address the readers, often switching views of the various major and minor characters, who give the narration a smoother flow by voicing their side of the story that's concerned with Daru. We come to know the man more via the eyes of others than his own thoughts and, grudgingly, dispute over his moral values and their drastic development.

However, Moth Smoke is subject to the more elite and the vile classes of the Pakistani society and not recommended to someone who's looking to pry deeper into the culture since this would be am incomplete representation of it.

***"There are two social classes in Pakistan," Professor Superb said to his unsuspecting audience, gripping the podium with both hands as he spoke. "The first group, large and sweaty, contains those referred to as the masses. The second group is much smaller, but its members exercise vastly greater control over their immediate environment and are collectively termed the elite. The distinction between members of these two groups is made on the basis of control of an important resource: air-conditioning."***

## Final Thoughts

Despite it all, based purely on entertainment value, it's more than good for everyone. The book also does not refrain from tackling taboo subjects in detail and banishing the odd and awkward aura of the conservative society. It's a purely adult fiction.

Flecked with bites of local vocabulary and inside jokes, the novel is a delight for cultural references. It's strong, its environment relatable and the virtual cruise through the named streets of Lahore makes the experience much more real than it actually is.

Ultimately, Moth Smoke is a love story going side-by-side with the disintegration of a once well-respected middle-class family man. The novel left a mark. It's also extremely well written and constantly reminded me of how much more exquisite and classier cultural literature can be.

Mohsin Hamid has become a star in my eyes.
