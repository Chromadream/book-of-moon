Here is why I prefer the old school love instead of the love millennial go through these
days. With the rise of technology and the internet, I believe the magic of love itself
has been stolen. The courtship that we saw in black and white movies no longer exist.
The constant chasing and waiting no longer a part of a relationship, or at least a casual
one. With everyone glued to their smartphones, myself included, I believe we’ve all
become co-dependent on our smartphones to guide us on matters such as Love, where
in reality you do not need Google to guide you, but just your heart (And your brain
too because we’ve all made miserable decisions following our heart sometimes).

## My Idea of Love.

As a young girl, filled with hopes and dreams (still do at this point) reading
Shakespeare (One among several other fantastic authors) and his love stories were a
deeply significant part in defining my views on finding the ‘*one*’. In The Merchant of
Venice by Shakespeare, he quotes:

***“One half of me is yours, the other half yours***

***Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,*** 

***And so all yours.”***

For a very long time my ideas around love grew up around the Victorian era, around
rainbows and sunshine and then bam! You have your first heartbreak and the world
tilts on its axis. You watch yourself get utterly devastated for having your hopes up
way too high, you cry yourself to sleep at night, and you almost throw away all of
your romantic hopes. DON’T! If I could say one thing to 18 year old me is that “*When
the time comes, your person will come too, until then enjoy life for what it has to offer
and keep your head high*”. Or at least that’s what I would have eloquently tried to say
among so many other advices.

## Romeo and Juliet.

It’s not wrong to shift your hopes onto having a Millennial Love, hell, I’ve
contemplated it far more times than I’d like to admit. But alas, when you’re a hopeless
romantic I’d say you would last no more than 5 minutes in this cold reality. I lasted 2
minutes. What I realized was that Love, your love to be specific, cannot be replicated
to the ones written by talented writers. We cannot have another Romeo climbing up
the balcony for Juliet (You) because that is ‘*their*’ love story and the one to come is
‘*yours*’. And also Romeo and Juliet’s love story was sort of tragic so let’s all hope it
does not end that way.

## Love in Technology.

You are unique, so is your Prince Charming, and so is your Love. Whether you are
interested in being courted, or indulging in a causal relationship, we’re living in a
century where technology cannot be avoided no matter how hard we try. Yes, it
absolutely has its downfalls. Social media and dating apps are becoming increasingly
popular and so the attraction of possibly meeting someone at the bookstore dies. You
are no longer in a relationship with your significant partner but also with the entire
world through Instagram posts.
Jennifer Behnke – A marriage and Family therapist – quoted in an article for
[Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/what-millennials-want-most-in-love-therapists_n_5ab926c3e4b0decad04ca453) saying:

***“They’re not looking for their mother’s marriage, since they’re waiting longer to have kids, the priority in the relationship is cultivating a sense of happiness and fulfillment with their partner.”***

Asking for financial equality, a stable relationship and a reliable and trustworthy
partner is the least of all wishes in the world today. People want someone who
thoroughly impress them and compliment their life to their upmost capacity instead of
unintentionally or intentionally diminishing it.

## Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, whether it is an old school love or the millennial love, we all
want to be with someone who is loyal, trustworthy, kind, thoughtful and honest. Love
books set a standard so high, most of the times it is quite unachievable but then again
those books exist to reaffirm our hope, faith and trust that magic, such as love, does
exist and that one day we may be lucky enough to find it and be in it. Which is why I
will always look out for romance and shooting stars in my life. As wary as reality
sounds, and as hard as it is to find love these days, I will always hold on to the hope
that someone out there is taking to the moon just like I am.
