## WT*?

“What the fuck did I just watch?”, I thought to myself as the credits rolled across my computer screen, 90 minutes after starting Batman Ninja on Netflix.

## What the movie is all about

Originally released in 2018, this animated extravaganza combines elements of DC comic-book action with a mostly anime backdrop by asking the timeless question, “What would happen if Batman and the DC ensemble were transported back in time to Feudal Japan, circa 15th century”? At least, that’s the question the trailer poses. Having watched the film, however, I think a more accurate question might actually be, “What would happen if Batman and DC ensemble had been invented in the 2000’s by the guys who made Dragon Ball Z and Yu-gi-ho, and they set out to make a movie? And then they ingested mushrooms?”

The general premise: Batman, the Joker and a dozen other DC characters are accidentally teleported from Gotham City to Japan some 400 years in the past. The Sengoku Period (15th – 16th century) was a particularly violent and unstable period in Japan, marred by power struggles between various shogans (warlords) and their families, each vying for control of the country. We follow our caped crusader two years after their misadventure, during which time our villains have established themselves as prominent shogans (warlords), each controlling their own piece of Japan and their own personal armies.

Without modern technology to aid him, our hero must rely purely on his physical prowess and skills in the martial arts to prevent history from being re-written and return to the present day. That is until he is discovered by an ancient ninja bat-clan. Who have a submarine.

By its third act, the film completely abandons its historical backdrop to become what it was always meant to be - an orgy of giant robot battles. Add into the mix mind-controlled samurai monkeys and 300 ft high bat “god”, to spice things up a bit.

## Not Bad.

The voice-acting is pretty much what one would expect from Japanese cartoon TV - I wouldn’t recommend watching this film with the English dub. While I couldn’t understand a word of dialogue, the subtitles seemed to provide a fairly comprehensible translation in English. Nothing unintentionally hilarious or too cringeworthy here, I’m happy to report.

In between the chaos, the film injects scenes of calm serving to develop the storyline. There is a particularly moving scene halfway through the film involving a rural farmer and his wife (no spoilers!), which incorporates elements of traditional Japanese water colour in its animation. Fans of the Penguin, Poison Ivy and Bane might be disappointed in the little screen-time these iconic characters are given. With so many characters crammed into this short 85 minute story, character development is mostly kept to a minimum.

## Final Opinion

Batman Ninja is refreshing take on an overcrowded sub-genre. Personally, I think IGN’s rating of 9.7 probably gives too much credit to a movie which is basically an anime DC-Transformers mashup - especially considering they gave Batman Begins a mere 9. Nonetheless, following a decade of Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy and Zak Snyder’s even bleaker interpretation of the masked hero, Batman Ninja offers some much needed respite from the world of serious bat-men.

Overall, I give this film 3½ nerd-gasms out of 5.
