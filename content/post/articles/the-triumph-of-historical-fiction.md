We grew up with heroes such as Percy Jackson and King Arthur, but very few of us make the transition from fiction to non-fiction. How many of us can say we know the victories of Alexander
the Great or the trials of the final Tsar of Russia with the same familiarity as the stories told at
Camp Half-Blood? Based on the ever-growing readership of fiction with a historical twist, I’d be
willing to bet many people equate this genre of twisted tales and exaggerated events with reading
true historical recounts. This is likely what draws us into the embrace of historical fiction in the
first place. After all, surely the author wouldn’t dare stray from the true timeline of the past? That’s
where I think many of those in our generation are mistaken.

## What We Were Taught in School

Throughout school, we are taught to never falsify our facts, and to present our information in
a format that is engaging for whoever may take the time out of their day to absorb the content we
produce. It’s only natural for us to have ingrained trust in any artist, author, or director because of
this, and therefore, I believe we neglect to acknowledge that historical fiction is just that; fiction.
We wholeheartedly believe throughout the story that the author did all of their research and wrote
their story without changing a single element of history. But if that were true, wouldn’t it just be
another piece of historical non-fiction that so many young readers avoid? By definition, one of our
favourite genres cannot be fiction without elements of its context being twisted, developed,
guessed, or even completely made up. This is what separates fiction from non-fiction, a concept
we all grow up with, from the day we set foot in the school’s library during English class or “silent
reading time”.

So, back to my original point. Why exactly do we drool over the idea of historical fiction?
Does it reflect our innate desire for a good story, or our human lust for knowledge?

In short, I believe it to be both.

## A Trip Back in Time

Let’s take a quick trip down memory lane, all the way back to the Stone Age. You know, the
one that people automatically associate with the idea of cavemen? Yep, that one. About 2.5
million years ago, our ancestors depicted their stories of triumph and woe on cold cave walls that
can now be found in many museums. Sure, these were basic images that can sometimes prove
difficult to translate into modern language, but they’re some of mankind’s first examples of story
telling. If human desire to share a tale or two with friends and family can date back as far as the
Paleolithic Era, I think it’s pretty safe to say this is why we’re so naturally drawn to stories, and
therefore, fiction. Similarly, I believe this is why we are so drawn to historical fiction in particular.
Many of these ancient tellings were the keys to survival, and without them, many of our ancestors
would not have lived. Stories of which plants were edible and how best to find shelter were key to
human survival. Arguably, knowledge is the key to survival, and this is why we are drawn to the
historical aspect of fiction. Simply put, we do not wish to repeat the deadly mistakes of others.

## Wrap Up

I believe historical fiction triumphs over historical non-fiction due to the lack of analysis
involved. Many historical texts involve in-depth analysis of “why things are the way they are”, an
element of story-telling many of our generation do not believe to be as important as the event
itself. But to those who immerse themselves in the world of true history, I applaud you. Without
knowledge of how the mistakes of the past were made, our generation cannot better ourselves or
our world.
