*“I've never listened to an audiobook before, and I have to say it's a totally different experience. When you read a book, the story definitely takes place in your head. When you listen, it seems to happen in a little cloud all around it, like a fuzzy knit cap pulled down over your eyes”* - __Robin Sloan__

The idea of listening to a 300 page book for 6-7 hours might seem daunting, but you don’t have to necessarily listen to the whole thing in one sitting. The good thing about audiobooks is you can perform other tasks while listening to your favourite books. This means you could finish a book in the span of a few days with minimal effort on your part and interruption to daily life.

Here are some benefits of listening to an audiobook.

* Listening to audiobook can make boring chores more enjoyable.

Whether it's cleaning the house, or sitting on the bus or train, hooking up your headphones to listen to a book can take your mind away from the monotony of daily routine. (you're not allowed to wear headphones and drive)

* You can absorb more content compared to reading.

Some audiobook apps offer the option of increasing playback speed to x2. Use this to your advantage.

* Listening to someone else read a book can be more beneficial than just reading it yourself.

This is especially true for those of you looking to improve your English skills. Listening to the author or a professional speaker can help improve both your speaking and listening skills, as you develop a sense for tone, inflection and pronunciation. It also helps to get a feel for how the author intended the book to sound - this is especially true of biographies or true stories.
