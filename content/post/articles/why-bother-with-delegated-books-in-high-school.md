I see a lot of the same behaviour my students pose towards the books that they have to go through in school as an English tutor, resentment, frustration, reluctance to refrain from the expedient path of rote learning their way out of writing essays.

## Unnecessary Knowledge

For most of us Victorians, we had to take at least one English subject in high school before we graduate, and a large number of us had to read and analyse a few books to sit the final exam. I don’t blame the involuntary, those who had to sit through classes and classes of endless indoctrination about themes and TEEL paragraphs when they could spend their time honing their knowledge and skills in avenues that matter to them. Reading books that you don’t really like can be mental (or physical) torture, and I agree that some aspects of our English education just needed some urgent refinements. However, I still think that delegated books in high school can provide quite the utility in terms of mental growth and maturity for a lot of students if they actually sat down and think deep into the books that they’re supposed to learn.

## My Personal Experience

I’ll take my own experience as an example. Since young, I was nerdy, socially awkward, bad at sports (you can see where this is going) and obsessed with whatever book I could get my hands on. Everything, from Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky’s philosophical literature to whatever crappy romance light-novel you could think of. The catch though is that I was quite self-conscious about my obsession, and I rarely showcased it to people I know (not the book club because some of the people there were quite scary, no offence). English class was the only place where I could truly be myself, and I could analyse and re-read books without ever feeling weird or guilty about it since everyone else had to do it anyways. In hindsight, it wasn’t easy either. I had to face demeaning criticism and my depleting self-esteem because my essays were essentially just waffle or that my interpretation of the texts was wonky.

## Everything was worth the time.

But it was worth it. Reading the same few books for an entire year while analysing snippets of non-sequitur replies or dramatic ironies did not make me a knowledge-regurgitating monster, it made me think. That persistent pressure made me think through every single lesson I’ve learnt through these books and every argument that lingered for every essay that I’ve written. Reading books back and forth with the intention to understand every essence of these books made me more articulate and praise the Dunning-Kruger effect it made me realised how ignorant I really was about the world. Getting criticised for the flaws within my arguments made me look inwards to other aspects of my stoic thought as well. Analysing books in English class gave me a new method of reading the books of my liking, and with some confidence, I can also say that I am much wiser than I was before by reading books this way. I will include some of these books in future reviews and what I’ve learnt from them, but I might need you to be patient and bear with my proclivity to procrastinate at this point (sorry).

English class felt like a slaughterhouse of my naive viewpoints in life, and this carries on to the basis of humanities education or what it’s supposed to be; an abattoir of ideas waiting to be slaughtered or approved, a catalyst for fruitful and productive debate in the name of advancing the knowledge of mankind. As quoted by the former president of the University of Chicago, “Education should not be intended to make people comfortable, it is meant to make them think”. Though I’m not studying humanities in university I agree with that perspective, and it would be tragic if instead of this approach to our humanities education the humanities were to devolve into frugal ideological warfare where instead of having articulated evidence as weapons people used ad hominem attacks and intellectual thuggery to win debates. It would be worse if instead of being a catalyst for refined thought and human progress the arts and humanities were to become a leeway for students to obtain a university degree for the sake of obtaining a tertiary qualification.

Who knows? Maybe this is already happening right now.

## Wrap Up

To my students who are reading this (I figured that they won’t), I know that some of you may see my teachings as spoon-feeding for your preparation to get high scores and forget about the English curriculum once you got into your desired course but try to think of your English education as an introduction to the humanities. Some of you might not be remotely interested in the humanities so maybe think of English and the books you are delegated to read as an introduction to being human or more specifically, a wise human being in society with the capability to think. However confined or inferior one might be, the ability and freedom to think will always set you free.
