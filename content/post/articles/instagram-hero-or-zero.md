Undoubtedly, the use of Social Media (especially Facebook and Instagram) has reduced the frequency of people reading books. It’s far easier to derive pleasure scrolling through their Instagram homepage or binge their favourite meme page in Facebook. Studies have shown the average person spends four hours a day on their smart device!

## Don’t Leave Social Media.

This is really surprising and I understand that browsing social media is 100x better than reading a hardback book. It is currently impossible to unattach ourselves from social media  with the current stream. Therefore, Book of Moon are here to relive the joy of reading from our talented writers who have enormous amount of knowledge in their respective genre, spreading content consistently through our digital medium so that people like you  would be intellectually stimulated and entertained.

The next question raised.

## Is Social Media Detrimental or is it actually Useful? 

Ultimately, it’s up to you to decide whether or not you want to use social media on a regular basis. However, I would suggest a couple of things to keep alive the spirit of reading in the digital age.

* Follow your favourite author or content creator on their social media platform of choice - someone you admire, whose works you enjoy reading or watching. Check to make sure they post regularly on their feed. 

* Utilise Goodreads, Youtube, Instagram for reviews & opinion. Use them as a preview before buying a certain book as they will help and assist you in making better decision when it comes to buying a book that you want to buy.

* Download Kindle/Audiobook on your phone. You will not regret this, the amount of content you can get from a certain author is inexplicably valuable.  There are a lot of hidden gems that you would not find in Youtube/Instagram/Facebook.
