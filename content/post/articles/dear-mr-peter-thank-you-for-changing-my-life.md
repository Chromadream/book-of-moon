Here’s my weak but somewhat trying attempt at creating a scenario on paper that I vividly remember. In grade two I was shifting schools (and houses) and on my last day, my homeroom teacher, Mr. Peter told me I could pick one and any book out of his humongous collection because he thinks that one day I am going to grow up and turn into a devoted reader. He practically even called me ‘Belle’ from ‘Beauty and The Beast’ (for always having my head buried in a storybook, like she does, all the time).

## Coincidence.

I picked out a book called “The Boy with the Red Balloon” by Albert Lamorisse. Honestly, at that point I was just attracted by the cover page and didn’t even know what kind of book it was or whether I would even like it in the first place. Funnily enough, I finished the book in two days and voila I think it is safe to say, that Mr. Peter was right and I would gladly accept it publicly any time of the day!  

There grew my love for books. My love for expressing thoughts, feelings and even the most complicated of emotions through words. You could even say my life took a 180 degree spin. Up until that day I looked at books as a way to pass time, but the moment I closed the book, I looked at reading as a way to explore so many other dimensions, realities, fantasies and even apply it to real life.

## Balloon – Friend or Foe?

The Boy with the Red Balloon is about a boy and his best friend- A red balloon in the captivating city of Paris. The balloon follows him around (as scary as it sounds) and acts as his friend, protecting him from bullies and offering solace in a big city. The story conveys a beautiful message about hope, light, friendship, reflection, and innocence.

The book taught me resilience, patience, and proved that through so many trials, hard work, faith and hope pays. When one hits rock bottom, it’s easy to forget the reason for it all, but there’s so much more than just getting a degree, then having a desk job. Yes those are quite necessary but if your road is a lot bumpier than others, it just means that you might take longer but you’ll get there.
