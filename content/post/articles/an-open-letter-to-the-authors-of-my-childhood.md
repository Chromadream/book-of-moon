Geronimo Stilton, Daisy Meadows, Chris d’Lacey, and many more; this one is for you.

I’ll start by saying thank you for giving me my love of reading. Without my chaotically organised
bookshelf of cheesy adventures, magical mysteries, and fiery fables, I doubt my love of reading
would have developed as deeply and as quickly as it did. I grew up dreaming of the stories I
would write and share, yearning for my own dramatic tellings. Without you all silently guiding me
from the pages of your books, who knows what I would have pursued through to adulthood.

## Gratitude.

Thank you for showing me the diversity of the writing world. Geronimo Stilton, your animated
novels of adventure were my first taste of journalism, however cheesy it may have been. Had I not
followed your story, I may not have chosen to pursue a journalistic career. Daisy Meadows, your
tales of pixies, fairies, and elves showed me the magic of fiction, the power of bringing words to
life, especially Lydia the reading fairy, who will always hold a place in my heart as one of my first
childhood heroes. Chris d’Lacey, you proved to me that not everything is as it seems, and that
you can find life and personality in anything if you look hard enough. The Fire Within showed me
from its first words that anything can have a story. These are all such small examples of the gifts I
received from your works, but I would not be the literature-obsessed girl I am today without your
hand in my upbringing.

I wish everyone could have shared in the adventures you shared with me. Maybe if we’d all
experienced such diversity at such a young age, we wouldn’t be faced with the diverse issues of
our modern world. We would not fear diversity; we would embrace it.
Finally, I just want to thank you for lighting the way to a bright and story-filled future. I owe much
of my love for writing to you.
