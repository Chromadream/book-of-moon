When we hear “vampire story”, the famous (or infamous) “Twilight” series of books and films comes to most people’s minds, with its too-good-to-be-true love story. If not “Twilight”, then it’s the popular series “Vampire Dairies” and the accompanying hit TV series. While both of these books have gained immense popularity around the world, in part due to their film and television adaptations, there are other vampire novels out there which have yet to achieve global recognition. Here are two that I’ve discovered which I wanted to share with you, my vampire-loving bookworms.

## Southern Vampire Mysteries

If you like stories about mystic creatures, fairies, vampires, and mind-readers, Charlaine Harris’ “Dead until Dark” (2001) and the subsequent “**The Southern Vampire Mysteries**” series of novels might just be for you. Despite being adapted into the popular HBO series “**True Blood**”, the novels themselves did not garner significant attention from audiences, at least not in the same way the Twilight and Vampire Diaries books have. However, I think any fan of vampire-themed stories ought to give this book a chance.

Taking place in a world where humans and vampires have been living together for decades. The book explores what such a world would look like in contemporary times and deals with themes such as social equity and race conflicts, as both species strive to peacefully co-exist with one another. Other mythical beings which exist in this universe include werewolves, witches and fairies, each with their own abilities and motivations.
The story revolves around a young human telepath who struggles to fit in with her peers as a result of her ability to read human minds. Imagine yourself on a lovely first date with a nice guy – he’s polite and seems innocent - and then you hear him say in his head “God! Look at that fine ass!” as he follows behind you.

In this world, vampires are only active at night and must remain dormant during the day (hence the title). They sustain themselves on a cocktail of specially formulated “synthetic blood” (rather than the blood of a living human), but are still vilified by their human counterparts. Imagine a Sidney Sheldon story, mixed with elements of the mythical and supernatural. And yes, the story contains strong violence and mature themes. I must warn this is not a book for all readers and it certainly isn’t suitable for younger audiences. However, if you have the stomach then I’d certainly recommend this series of books.

## Blue Bloods

A vampire series more appropriate for audiences of all ages is Melissa de la Cruz’s **“Blue Bloods” (2006 - 2011)**. In this world, vampires have inhabited the earth since medieval times, hiding in plain sight and rising to power through the centuries. Referred to as “Blue Bloods”, they are among the wealthiest individuals in world and use their power to keep their immortality a secret.
Our protagonist, a 15 year-old school girl, discovers one day that she’s half-human, half-vampire when she begins to crave blood. Soon after, a body is discovered on the school grounds and she begins her own investigation into the killing as well as the connection to her own mysterious identity. Taking elements from popular young-adult fiction, the story delves into mystery, adventure and romance, as our protagonist very quickly becomes embroiled in a centuries-old war between two ancient vampirical clans.
At times, the story leaves the realm of believability in order to achieve its end goals. It nonetheless has its own way of pulling you in its world, and will have you invested in its story and characters in no time!

That’s it, folks! These are the two series I am recommending at this point in time. Try to read works from as many different authors as you can, as every author has their own unique way of pulling you into their story. Happy reading!
