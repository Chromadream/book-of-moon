Most of the stories people will encounter in their lives will contain a morally good protagonist, a hero who overcomes a villain, a flaw, or some other form of obstacle to accomplish their goals, exemplifying desirable traits that inspire readers to follow their example. The work of Flannery O’Connor does not contain such heroes. Living from 1925 to 1964 in the Southern United States, specifically Georgia and Iowa, Flannery O’Connor recognised the great divide between people and how poorly we could treat each other. Her collection of short stories is critically acclaimed, and her work is renowned for tackling issues surrounding race, class and illness by its frequent use of grotesque, unlikeable characters in seemingly mundane situations.

## Our flaws.

With an ensemble of wholly unlikeable characters, one could reasonably wonder why they should ever be interested in reading such a story. Despite the lack of a white knight embodying the moral message of the story, her stories still contain incredibly deep characterisation which acts as an insightful analysis into human flaws and allows her audience to potentially gain self-awareness into their own behaviours. Her stories have a rare strength in them because this lack of a morally good protagonist allows a more in-depth focus on the morally corrupt, showing the audience dark blights that could normally hide beneath the appearance of the white knight.

## Flannery O'Connor best works

In two of her stories, *The Geranium* and *The Barber*, O’Connor demonstrates how her characters all believe themselves to be some form of this white knight but due to our omniscience as the audience we can clearly identify their flawed reasoning and why they fall short of being a moral hero.

In The Geranium, the main character and focus is Old Dudley, a man who has been forced to relocate from his farm in the south to his daughter’s apartment in New York City. Dudley brings his southern attitudes with him, hating the cramped city lifestyle and his African-American neighbour. The climax of the story shows a frail Dudley being helped up the stairs by this African-American neighbour, with the latter treating him like an equal and the former being in denial, unable to comprehend how such a man could help him.

By the events of the story and Dudley’s reactions, we can infer his racist and backwards views towards the world but by also being able to see his thoughts through our readers’ omniscience, we can understand that Dudley is ultimately grappling for control and the loss of control is the cause for his grotesqueness. In this story O’Connor is forcing us to recognise not just what’s wrong with the man but why the man is wrong and why he behaves this way. She demonstrates not only that this man is irritable and racist but the reasons why he is racist, supporting a deeper understanding of the issue.

## Challenging the status quo.

In contrast to this is The Barber, the story of a professor in the south who is voting for a socially progressive democrat while his barber and his clients are voting for the status-quo protecting republican. While The Barber and his clients are grotesque, unlikeable characters due to their political opinions and treatment of the African-American barber shop boy, the professor nearly reaches this level of a moral hero until he is revealed as being heavily flawed by failing to understand his own reasons for his actions and by trying to justify his political views to an audience refusing to listen. The climax sees the professor failing to convince The Barber shop and ultimately resorting to violence as he pushes The Barber away and flees the shop, sinking to the level of The Barber shop audience who refuses to listen. The revelations made by the professor and The Barber demonstrates why it is important to be self-aware and to understand how and why we ourselves do the things we do.

Flannery O’Connor’s work with grotesque characters is brilliant not only due to the well-written, deep characterisation but also by her use of them to share important messages with the audience. While a heroic protagonist can help an audience identify what traits are good and admirable, the grotesque characters in these stories help an audience recognise negative traits, the causes and underlying factors in such traits and how the audience can be self-aware of these traits. This ultimately provides the audience with a more nuanced and deeper understanding of the issues discussed in the work of Flannery O’Connor.
