One of the writers who has consistently had an impact on me with his stories is Stephen King, the aptly nicknamed “King of Horror”. Many people seem to agree as his books have sold over 350 million copies, been produced as films or tv shows and received numerous awards. He has published 58 full length novels, the majority of which are epics widely recognised in pop culture such as *The Shining*, *Misery*, *Needful Things* and *IT*. Despite the public popularity and acclaim for these novels, many people would be surprised as I was to discover that he also has another **200** short stories that often receive critical acclaim but rarely make the same impact on the public as his novels do. Having read many of these short stories, I have selected five of the most interesting, underappreciated short stories written by Stephen King.

## Batman and Robin have an Altercation

While the title may read like a fan-fiction, this story (likely to the disappointment of many) does not contain the actual Batman and Robin. It is instead about a man who takes his Alzheimer’s afflicted father on their regular Sunday lunch, during which the father has an unusual moment of clarity as he recalls the father and son duo dressing as the caped crusader and his sidekick for Halloween nearly half a century ago. Small moments of clarity and happiness like these are interwoven throughout the story that depicts a man’s strained and alternating views of his father, resulting in a compelling and emotionally gripping story.

## The Death of Jack Hamilton

While Stephen King is known as the “King of Horror”, this does not mean that he is restricted or only capable of writing horror and this story is the proof. Rather than a tale of horror, this is instead a true crime style piece, depicting the slow and painful death of Jack Hamilton, a man working in Dillinger’s gang. This fictional story demonstrates King’s unquestionable writing ability as he turns real-life people and incidents into larger than life characters in a thrilling true crime story.

## All That You Love Will Be Carried Away

Revolving around a single character, this story contains a dark and cynical view of life through the eyes of a depressed travelling salesman. What this story lacks in action or plot it more than compensates with a detailed character whose turmoil creates an inescapable sense of tension. The ending and ultimate resolution made by the man being left ambiguous creates a crescendo of tension that remained with me even after I put the story down.  

## That Bus Is Another World

Inspired by the traffic of Paris, this story is notable for its capability to challenge our sense of morality and societal attitudes within the typically mundane scene of taking a taxi in rush hour traffic. The character witnesses a brutal crime on a nearby bus and must make a difficult decision; does he do something to try and help or does he ignore it, justifying the latter decision because there are other people around who could help instead. The moral dilemma presented to the man, and his ultimate decision, is a cold reflection on societal attitudes that is as simultaneously chilling and realistic as any other piece of horror written by King.

## The End of the Whole Mess

This story is one of the older ones in this list, being first published in 1986 makes it older than I am, and it is also very distinct due to its science fiction nature. The story revolves around a duo of brothers who discover a chemical which induces non-aggression in humans. The story ultimately serves as a cautionary tale, gripping us to the very last page with each twist reveal used by King to remind us that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

## Conclusion

Stephen King’s short stories are often overlooked in favour of his novels, but I believe that his short stories deserve more attention. They often tackle very real issues in human life and I chose to highlight the five particular stories above because they exemplify King’s ability to reflect the nuances and intricacies of these issues in his own fictional works.
