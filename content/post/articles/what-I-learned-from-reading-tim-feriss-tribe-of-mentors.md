“A mentor is someone who allows you to see the hope inside yourself” - Oprah Winfrey

Tribe of Mentors is a collection of over 100 mini-interviews conducted by podcaster and entrepreneur Tim Ferris, where some of the world's most successful people share their ideas and experiences regarding their successes, failures, relationships and their life.

I believe that we can learn from successful people and gain insight into their wisdom, success stories and their mistakes. We have been fortunate enough that the 21st century has allow us all to connect with others through the internet and social media.

By getting insight to the mind of these people I learned that it’s okay to have mistakes in our lives and get inspired from the people that you admire.

It’s amazing how Timothy Ferris compiled a great interview to the top 1% of people in their field such as Mark Cuban, Jimmy Fallon, Gary Vaynerchuk, Arianna Huffington, Ray Dalio, Steve Aoki and Daniel Negreanu to name a few. You won’t get these answers on Youtube/Google as they are privately interviewed by Timothy Ferris himself.

Here’s a list of 4 Top Tim Ferris question that he asked to these people.

* “What is the book (or books) you’ve given most as a gift, and why? Or what are one to three books that have greatly influenced your life?”

* “How has a failure, or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Do you have a “favorite failure” of yours?”

* “What advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to enter the “real world”? What advice should they ignore?”

* “What are bad recommendations you hear in your profession or area of expertise?”

## Wrap Up

I believe it’s important to have a mentor who can guide you in your life, and who can share personal experiences that will both inspire and motivate you.
