Dan Brown gained his reputation with the ever so controversial “**Angels and Demons**” (2000) and “**Davinci Code**” (2003) which made a huge impact in the Hollywood. The protagonist in these two novels is called Robert Langdon, some believe he is very much similar to the author himself.
But the protagonist has not always been Robert Langdon in all of his novels.

## Who is the real Hero?

One of them is a female protagonist called Susan Fletcher form “Digital Fortress” (1998). Digital Fortress is a techno thriller novel which brings light upon the government surveillance of electronically saved information of private life of citizens and the ethical implications of using such a technology. The story revolves around a code called digital fortress which can’t be broken by NSA’s super computers TRANSLTR, the task falls upon the capable hands of the head cryptographer Susan Fletcher. She figures out that it was written by a former NSA employee who was very much displeased with the public surveillance, he threatens NSA to reveal it to the public else the decryption code would be auctioned off, else his partner “North Dakota” would release it for free if he was to be dead. The agency is dead set to obtain this code which has now become a national threat.

But what do you do when the person who is threatening you ends up dying, and the clock starts ticking? Susan’s fiancé David Becker who is a professor of modern languages joins her in her quest to safeguard the public and the nation. The story takes interesting turns of events and mysteries. For its time the novel has been pretty advance in the coding world and introduced the public to cyber threat.

In this novel Dan Brown bought forward the important role of women in IT even before it was a thing, the tech typhoons like USA and Japan were highlighted and the alignment of literal language with coding language was very beautifully achieved. A lot of assumptions about the NSA and Seville were criticized by the GCN, 7 years after the book was realized Dan Brown was invited to visit Seville to dispel the inaccuracies.

Although most of Dan Browns novels have been criticized or been involved in controversies, they have always been very thrilling and mysterious.

## Why you should read it.

Digi-4 (as I like to call it) is a pretty rare novel to find in the stores, which makes it even more interesting. For the people in the fields of IT and coding, it is very intriguing. For the people who have never read it, they are introduced to a whole new world. We are talking about the 20th century when the software platform was just beginning to be accessible by the general public and the idea of being watched by the vary government that upheld their privacy and security can be nerve wrecking. Susan undergoes an intense revelation of the consequences of their technology, which ends up with her almost losing her life. The intertwined fate of the threat and her life draws you in as if you were the one feeling it.

For those who are into techno-crime-thriller novels, this is highly recommended.

Next time we will be back with more of Dan Brown. Till then happy reading!
