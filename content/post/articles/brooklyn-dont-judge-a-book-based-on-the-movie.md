Let’s face it. The act of reading out of interest rather than necessity is a dying art. This could be blamed on multiple things. The ever globalising world, accessibility of other hobbies, the fast paced lifestyle we all tend to be swept up in. But personally I think it’s all due to the transition of books to movies.  No judgement here, we all love a good movie. But those of us that are advocates of the books still are often heard proclaiming: “The movie was alright, but not as good as the book.”  So yes, call me a snob if you will. But this is me saying the book was better than the movie. The first book I’ve chosen to write on is possibly my favourite book of all time. Colm Tóibín’s “Brooklyn” (2009). Adapted to film in 2015, it was recently uploaded to Netflix and scored a solid 7.5/10 on IMDb. There is no doubt the film was good and captured the heart of Tóibín’s work, but the book was better. 

Tóibin’s story follows the tale of a young Irish immigrant on her journey to America. Very much a coming of age story, but in place of the teeth–clenching teenage angst, there are Tóibín’s haunting words that capture the torment of the protagonist. The heroine grapples with feelings of homesickness and grief, all while experiencing her first romance. The cultural melting-pot that is Brooklyn in the 1950s is a stark contrast to the heroine’s small Irish hometown, and represents her struggle at being torn between two worlds. Neither fully Irish, nor American. Her weakness of not fully fitting in either community, comes to a pinnacle when she has to choose between them. Ultimately, her being from both is seen as a strength when she has the life experience toward the end of the novel. Having been through such trying situations, led to her strength in character and is shown in her transgression from a stage of young adulthood, to womanhood at the culmination of the novel.

Colm expertly combines comedy, tragedy and romance in this all-encompassing novel. For me, it is a go-to book recommendation for anyone who wants to laugh and cry in the same sentence.  If you’ve watched the movie and enjoyed it you should definitely read this book. If you watched the movie and didn’t really like it, you should still read the book, it’ll probably change your opinion.
