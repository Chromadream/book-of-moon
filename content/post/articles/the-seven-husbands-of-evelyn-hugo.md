Today we are going to be perusing the pages of “The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo” by Taylor Jenkins Reid, a book which some describe as a romance novel, others see it as psychological fiction, but really, the only thing you need to know is that this book is damn good. Personally, I never enjoyed books that would fit into the category of Chick Lit, but between you and me, I was so glued to the book that I finished all 385 pages in one sitting, and I wouldn’t blame you if you did the same.

## THE PLOT

![second](/inline/seven-husbands/second.gif)

In the book, we follow the life of Monique Grant, a struggling journalist who’s been going through the mundane motions of life after her recent divorce. However, this all changes when Evelyn Hugo, a sort of hybrid between Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn, the renowned queen of the 1950s silver screen, requests to have her biography written, by none other than Monique Grant herself. At first, Monique is hesitant to accept the job and asks for it to be passed to a more senior journalist, that is until Evelyn Hugo gives the ultimatum that, if Monique won’t write the biography, no one will. So begins Monique’s journey of interviewing and writing for Ms. Hugo, because at the end of the day, everyone in the world still wants to know, out of all the seven husbands that Evelyn Hugo had, which one was the true love of her life?

Yes, you read that right. Our main character Evelyn Hugo had seven different husbands, seven! I don’t know about you, but to me that’s seven husbands too many.

## BUT WHAT IS THE BOOK REALLY ABOUT?

Don’t be fooled by the books title, because deep down this is the true story of Evelyn Hugo, the pure unedited truth, behind the façade that she had to display throughout her entire life. Evelyn Hugo was a Cuban woman aspiring to make it in a white man’s world, split between being out and proud about her heritage and supressing it to gain the Hollywood fame that she’s always wanted, and, for a long time she did supress herself. This is what makes her such a deeply flawed yet still likeable character, one that you just keep waning to know more about, because she’s lied, because she’s got faults and flaws, because she is human. This is a woman who’s desperate to have her real story heard, the one that shows us how cutthroat it is to succeed in Hollywood, the realistic complexities of her marriages, divorces, her one true love and of course the mystery of why she chose Monique Grant to write her biography.

## THE HUSBANDS

Each of Evelyn Hugo’s husbands were all part of some ploy to increase their fame and gain notoriety for dating Evelyn Hugo, and she would go along with it if it benefitted her in some way. Don’t get me wrong, she was fond of her husbands, but I wouldn’t quite call it love, and building a marriage on anything less than that will lead to, well, divorce. Each and every time Evelyn went through a divorce, she was ripped to shreds in the public eye, tabloids all over the world blaming her for not being able to keep a husband. But Evelyn is the kind of woman who fought tooth and nail to get where she is, and she isn’t going to let a divorce tear her down, let alone seven of them. All of this could have convinced Evelyn to not continue, to just give up and let herself spiral downward into a depression and at some points, she almost did, especially after her husband Harry, who would beat her after promising to never do it again. But, there was one person in her life that she lived for, the one that she truly loved and that kept her going even in the darkest times, the one that no one knew about until now.

## WHO WAS THE TRUE LOVE OF EVELYN'S LIFE?

While working on the set of a movie, Evelyn met a woman named Celia St James, who was her co-star and soon to be best friend. The two would hang out together at parties, gossip about all the other actresses and eventually fall in love with one another. Over the years the two had a bond that they couldn’t deny, but at the risk of public ridicule and homophobia, Evelyn chose to keep their relationship out of the public eye, even when Celia St James wanted to shout their love from the rooftops. Their relationship was complicated, and had more ups and downs than a rollercoaster, but they still loved each other, bared their souls and truth to each other and that is what Evelyn believes is real, true intimacy. I won’t completely spoil the entirety of their relationship, but just know that by the end of it you might be crying!

## BUT WHY PICK MONIQUE GRANT?

Taylor Jenkins Reid is utterly talented at spinning and weaving a story so multi-faceted and all consuming that you won’t want to put it down, mainly because you’re dying to know more about Evelyn Hugo but also, because underneath it all, you still want to know why Evelyn Hugo was so adamant about picking Monique Grant. When we are nearing the end of Evelyn’s story we find out that Monique and her family are tied into it in a way that I did not see coming, and neither did Monique, and as soon as it is revealed, there is a moment, where you don’t know if you hate Evelyn Hugo or admire her and feel guilt for all that she has been through. It would be a crime for me to reveal what exactly this little twist is, because it is something you absolutely need to experience for yourself, but just know that when I read it, I had to pause for about 5 minutes, put the book down and then re-read the page again just to be sure that what I read was true.

## Final Thoughts

‘The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo’ by Taylor Jenkins Reid is a must read for anyone and is honestly one of my favourite books of all time. I don’t think I will ever be able to forget the raw realness and message this story has left me with and I will most likely read it again just to experience the amazing storytelling that Taylor Jenkins Reid provides.

Rating: 5/5
