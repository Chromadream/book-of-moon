This article may contain some spoilers (I’ll keep it to a minimum), but one of the many life lessons that I’ve learnt from this sitcom was that “sometimes even if you know something’s gonna end, that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy the ride”, which is why I hope that you’ll enjoy this ride as much as I did.

How I Met Your Mother - how do I put this? The sitcom has always been a guilty pleasure of mine, especially when I felt there weren’t people around me I could share my life with, alongside its burdens, and intricacies that I was and am still afraid to open up to other people. Setting aside the corny jokes and some very predictable (also cringe-worthy) moments, How I Met Your Mother felt a lot like a mentor and a trustworthy friend, it felt like a genuine microcosm of life that sitcoms, in general, don’t usually convey.

## The Characters

If you haven’t watched the sitcom already, HIMYM basically revolves around 5 similar-aged friends and their romantic relationships, with one person in particular who struggles to maintain fruit-bearing relationships with women for more than a decade, until he met “The Mother”. One would assume that based on the simplicity of this show’s premise, HIMYM’s plot would be limited to exploring only a few themes, that writers would basically paint caricatures of “people” as filler for 20-minute episodes. At least I did, but boy was I wrong - and I was completely blown away.

While HIMYM seems to have based their central characters off very comical personalities (Lily and Marshall the loving, long-term couple, Robin, the foreign, gun-loving, news-reporting, commitment-avoiding tomboy who is surprisingly very attractive, Barney (the most comical of them all), the misogynistic, self-loving and typical corporate American, and Ted, the sometimes pretentious, and overthinking hopeless romantic), it didn’t feel as if the writers were taking their personalities to the point where they were laughable. Barney, for example, escaped one-night-stands through despicable means plenty of times, but what was beautiful about his character arc was that he is shown to pertain intimate love towards the things and people that he cared about, his friends (    whom he almost died for), Robin (whom he fell in love with), and his mother. It’s not just Barney though, every other character had similar dualities in their personalities that may or may not contradict one another, which made HIMYM felt so human.

## Life lessons

The other thing I liked about HIMYM, which ultimately stemmed from the complex rendition and writing of their characters’ personalities, is its plethora of lessons and differing perspectives on friendships, romance, and life in general. Didactic elements from this show range from seemingly insubstantial points like “nothing good happens after 2 a.m. (“just go home and go to sleep”), to Ted’s interpretation of love:

***“If you’re looking for the word that means caring about someone beyond all rationality and wanting them to have everything they want no matter how much it destroys you, it’s love. And when you love someone you just, you…you don’t stop, ever. Even when people roll their eyes, and call you crazy. Even then. Especially then. You just—you don’t give up. Because if I could just give up…if I could just, you know, take the whole world’s advice and—and move on and find someone else, that wouldn’t be love. That would be… that would be some other disposable thing that is not worth fighting for. But I—that’s not what this is.”***

Some of these may sound absurd and cheesy, but as I’ve mentioned before, moments like these paint a very genuine microcosm of modern life and human relationships. Compared to many other, rather unpleasant sitcoms (*cough* The Big Bang Theory *cough*), the show’s general mood fluctuates with every enticing story Ted tells his children. For every jovial event that lifts the mood of the audience, there will be equally heavy events construed throughout to take us back to reality. Even though the entire story is based on Ted’s recollection of past events which he shares with his children, the writers have an excellent grasp on the intricacies of time and relationships, from the characters’ relationships with each other to missed opportunities and mistakes. It paints how friends can be fortunate enough to come together at a certain point in time, but also how close friends will eventually and inevitably part ways, in some form or another. For most of the show itself, I’d give perfect scores.

## Criticisms

If you hadn’t noticed, I said I’d give most of HIMYM a perfect score, and that holds true in my opinion, as there are still aspects within HIMYM that could see improvement, albeit not by much. For a borderline obsessive like myself, the show’s lack of continuity was uncomfortable to bear, but perhaps I’m just nitpicking. Like many others, I wasn’t too big on the final season. Athough I enjoyed the plot, I felt the general pacing of the season should have been much slower, while the finale could’ve been stretched into multiple episodes as well. (To avoiding treading into spoiler territory, I won’t go any further into the details of these plot points!)

## Overall opinion

Despite all of that I am still quite content with the entirety of the series,  since “you can’t just tack on a new ending because you’re not satisfied with how a story wraps up”. For a sitcom, HIMYM felt very enriching in its content and story-telling and I’d recommend this to everyone who’s looking into sitcoms that won’t bore you to death with their corny jokes (*cough*).
