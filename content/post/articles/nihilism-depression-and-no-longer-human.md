Since this is my first article on this website I figured that I should talk about one of my all-time favourites, “No Longer Human” by Osamu Dazai. Considered as one of the writer’s most well-known and significant work in his fleeting life, “No Longer Human” ranks as the second best-selling novel in Japan, just behind the ground-breaking “Kokoro” by Natsume Soseki. Osamu Dazai is still considered a cult classic in the West though, as most of his works are only available in Japanese.

## The Story.

“No Longer Human” reads like your typical, dreamy, slice-of-life I-novel, a popular genre in modern Japan. It revolves around the life of a disenfranchised outcast, his morbid perceptions on human beings and relationships with several human beings important to his life. Since the beginning of the book, the narrator claims that he is unable to fathom what it means to be human, and despite experiencing bouts of love and affection provided by his friends and several women throughout his life he couldn’t pull himself out of his state of perpetual misery. This nihilistic undertone persists throughout the novel, with no clear signs of the narrator’s recovery. “No Longer Human” can be considered as a semi-autobiography of the author himself and his seemingly endless struggle with depression and suicide. Dazai was defeated by his desire to kill himself though, as he commits double suicide with his lover at the time, Tomie Yamazaki in 1948.

## A ritual for myself.

I was introduced to this book by a friend when I was 15, and since then I have made a ritual to re-read the book every year. What’s most astounding is that to me this book conveyed polarising signals and messages every time I read it. The writing and translation for this book are impeccable, even after the removal of slight nuances and literary conventions from Japanese the string of thought of this book was perfectly conveyed. I have yet to come across a book of this theme that articulates depression and mental health difficulties so accurately, yet with such charming language:

*“What frightened me was the logic of the world; in it lay the foretaste of something incalculably powerful. Its mechanism was incomprehensible, and I could not possibly remain closeted in that windowless, bone-chilling room. Though outside lay the sea of irrationality, it was far more agreeable to swim in its waters until presently I drowned.”*

## Transition of my life.

For a book with such confronting themes of existential angst and nihilism, it is of no surprise that this book is not well-promoted in the West. Ironically, this book has helped me refrain from major periods of emotional difficulties and bouts of depression as I slowly transitioned into adulthood. It provided me with an intimate sense of connection and relatability to the author and narrator of the novel despite the ongoing romanticism of suicide and what it means to be a social outcast. Unsurprisingly “No Longer Human” resonated with many people whom I’ve personally recommended this book to, the same way it has resonated with me. At times we often shower ourselves with a self-deprecating pessimism that we just do not belong in the broader community, we are just bound to be ostracised and framed with repugnant epithets aimed to separate us from society itself. In light of all its destructive themes and description of what it is to be an antithesis of “being human”, “No Longer Human” demonstrates that this phenomenon is far more common than we think it may be. It reminds us that however isolated we might be, we are and should not be alone when confronting our deepest anxieties and mental health difficulties.

## Wrap Up

*“People talk of “social outcasts.” The words apparently denote the miserable losers of the world, the vicious ones, but I feel as though I have been a “social outcast” from the moment I was born. If ever I meet someone society has designated as an outcast, I invariably feel affection for him, an emotion which carries me away in melting tenderness.”*

If you think that you are not emotionally capable of reading a novel that deals with suicide and depression through graphical and horrifying representations of such though, I would suggest keeping it away from your to-read list for now. However, this book has proven to be a riveting experience and a favourite for most who savoured it to its very essence, and I would definitely recommend this novel if you think you are able to handle its strong message.
