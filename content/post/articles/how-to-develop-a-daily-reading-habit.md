*“Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body”, Sir Richard Steele.*

I wasn’t a regular reader until I was 17. I hated the idea of reading a 300 page book, which could take me days, weeks or even months. Now, I find reading as easy as watching a movie.

The first book I picked up and really enjoyed was *Opening the Door of Your Heart: And Other Buddhist Tales of Happiness* by Ajahn Brahm. Initially, I wasn’t really interested in Buddhism but I was stunned by the lessons I learned and was enthralled by the stories about hope, forgiveness, and freedom.

How to get into the habit of reading

In his book, The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg cites the habit loop, three steps for developing a habit which consist of:

* Cue

Trigger that tells you execute a certain set of actions. Ask yourself, “why should I get into the habit of reading a book?”. There are a lot of benefits to reading.

It’s important that you leave yourself a reminder to read regularly, as it’s all too easy to forget. However you want to do this is entirely up to you. For example, find some place where you spend most of your time and leave a book there. This could be your living room, your bedroom or on your work desk.

* Routine

Make reading part of your routine. Initially you will have to be aware and make a schedule for it . For instance, if you tell yourself, “I’m going to read a book for 15 minutes everyday”, and given enough time this will develop into a habit.

* Reward

Feedback that your brain uses to decide if the habit is something useful to remember. At the end of each reading session, reward yourself with something you enjoy - television, YouTube or even chocolate. After a few weeks, you can try to gradually wean yourself off these treats but when starting out, this is a powerful incentive. Eventually, you should find yourself wanting to go back to read the book, even without promising yourself a Snickers by the end. It’s vital that you fall in love with the act of reading, rather than the idea of reading, so you must find a book that appeals to your interests.

Regularly ask yourself, “Did this book change my perspective?” "Was I entertained with how the writer expressed his ideas?" "Was I intrigued by the characters and the plotline?"

I believe everyone should get into the habit of reading. Regardless of the genre, a great book or article will bring you value in multiple forms. Personally, I find reading regularly has improved my memory, my imagination and my critical thinking skills.
