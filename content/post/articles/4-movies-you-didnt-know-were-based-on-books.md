## Psycho (1960)

Arguably Hitchcock’s greatest work, and one of the best examples of early horror, Psycho (1960) was based on a 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch. A protege of H.P. Lovecraft, Bloch began his writing career at age 17, spending his early years writing short horror stories for popular “pulp” magazines such as Weird Tales. Taking inspiration from masters such as Lovecraft and Bram Stoker, Bloch’s stories often revolved around madness and murder with stories revolving around figures such as Jack the Ripper and Dr. Jekyll. This eventually culminated in his most successful novella, Psycho, with a central character inspired and loosely based on real-life murderer Ed Gein. The book was well received upon release and caught the attention of one Alfred Hitchcock.
So impressed was Hitchcock, he used own money to finance a significant portion of the film’s budget and famously ordered that all copies of Bloch’s novel be bought up from bookstores so that audiences would enter theatres completely unaware of the book’s twist ending.
The release of Psycho in theatres the following year propelled Bloch into the spotlight. Unfortunately, this would be the peak of his career, although Bloch would continue writing his short horror pieces for pulp magazine with moderate success. Two decades later, he was invited to write an episode for the 1980s TV Show Alfred Hitchcock Presents.
Psycho remains one of the most celebrated, well-known works of cinematography of all time.
