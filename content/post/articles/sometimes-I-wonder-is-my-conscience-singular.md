*Thought inspired by the novel “Tell me your dreams” written by Sidney Sheldon.*

## Have I lost it?

Nope! I certainly have not, thank you very much. I mean I was perfectly fine pretending my brain was normal and I was a very functional human being until I read this book. Holly molly!

I often tend to talk to myself, you know when you need expert advice, but then it got me wondering, was it I who answered my questions or a part of my conscience I wasn’t aware of? If you do the same, fear not you aren’t the only one.

“Tell me your dreams” as innocent as this phrase sounds the meaning is far from it. It all began with the rhyme ***“All around the mulberry bush, the monkey chased the weasel, the monkey thought 'twas all in fun, Pop! Goes the weasel.”***

You might be thinking what’s so wrong about this? Well, well, well, the rides just begun.

The main character is Ashley Patterson, who is an introverted workaholic. In addition, there are two other women, Toni and Alette. These three don’t go along with each other, Especially Toni, who criticises Ashley pretty harshly.

## Into the story we go…

Like I said the story revolves around three women, all very much different to each other, one’s workaholic, ones an artist, others sexy and outgoing. All so different and yet they talk to each other. As you read, you experience the lives of these three women, until Ashley is threatened to be killed by a warning written on her mirror with a lipstick. Well pretty obvious now, she calls the cops, scared as shit, and alone.

A police escort stays to support her, only to be found dead the very next day.

Dayum! Shit just got real eh? Funnily enough, there have been two other similar murders, after an investigation it’s been deduced that Ashley, Alette, Toni are all the very same person. Classic case of Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) still, very hard to believe.

The second half of the story involves her being arrested, and for her rescue Ashley’s dad requests an attorney friend to defend her. Remember the rhyme? It was something her other personality sang a lot, it was Alette. When she got arrested, her attorney David, notices differences in the identities. They were very unique and varied in age, enough to make her look younger or older. David, being the man that he is, could not resist the beauty that Ashley was, and fell for her. But reality struck hard and he had to keep it professional (Sad reacts only) as witty as he was, he managed to prove her DID and requested for medical help.

That’s the que for a new character, the ever so friendly and caring doctor Gilbert. (Hang on peeps don’t lose your shit just yet!). Dr Gilbert, young and charming, treats Ashley to find out that the first personality was born when her dad sexually abused her. And the second one was born when she was 8 years old and her dad raped her. Her mother never believed it, and when she died in an accident, Alette sang the song “All around….” (you see how eerie it gets?)

While treating Ashley, Dr Gilbert fell in love with her, during the treatment, Toni suggests pretending to disappear, Ashley however, has gained the memories of these identities and in fact goes along with the plan. After she is thought to be cured, she meets David and tells him everything, and it dawns upon him as to why he was requested to defend Ashley, he could never tell it to others. (sly father!).

What happens next? Well she visits her dad and kills him, Toni gets her revenge (Because now she remembers). On her way back, she hums the rhyme again.

***“All around the mulberry bush, the monkey chased the weasel, the monkey thought ‘twas all in fun, Pop! Goes the weasel.”***

## Final thoughts

I believe Ashley concluded that the only ones who could protect her and make her happy would be Toni and Alette. She accepted them and decided to make her dad pay for what he did.

As the book quotes “There could have been a terrible ending for her, but this was the happy ending she had prayed for. *I’m on my way at last.* And as the train headed toward The Hamptons, she began to sing softly.”

So, tell me, is your conscience singular?
