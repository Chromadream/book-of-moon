Velvet Buzzsaw is a Netflix film offering a commentary regarding the fine art world and a satirical view of the people who populate it. Despite its brilliant cast including Jake Gyllenhaal and John Malkovich, the film is now mostly remembered as a B-grade horror film with a rather niche group of fans. When I watched the film, I largely felt that it was enjoyable but not as amazing as it aspired to be. Despite this feeling however, what it does well, it does exceptionally well. There are certain messages and questions the film raised which stood out and resonated with me because they extend beyond the world of fine art and more into day-to-day life, including our own reading and writing behaviours.

## How important is listening to the Critics?

Jake Gyllenhaal’s character Morf Vandewalt is a fine art critic, with a reputation of being the best of the best. His opinion, as shown on several occasions, can make or break an artist’s career. However, at each and every chance the film gets, it undermines this status as a critic. His internal struggle often returns to the dilemma of a bad review he gave for an exhibition he loved, due to being pressured into doing so by his girlfriend as the artist was her ex. In one exchange, he comments on an artwork by saying the painter was better before he gave up drinking, only to be informed that the particular artwork was made before he quit, a mistake which Morf nimbly navigates around. This consistent undermining of Morf is the film’s satirical message of ignoring the critics and instead trusting how we feel about something. Because art, reading and writing are all very personal experiences, we should read what we like and not what critics tell us to read.

## Do what’s good for you? Or what you’re good at?

Although a surprisingly minor character, John Malkovich’s Piers is an artist who is suffering critically due to the changes in his artistic process after giving up drinking for his health. The point that his artwork was better when he was drinking is hammered home by its repetition by Morf and gallery owner Rhodora, who clearly care more about the quality of his art than his health. Despite this however, Piers is the only main character who survives the events happily, featuring in the final shot at the beach drawing curved lines in the sand. The message the movie makes clear here is to focus on what’s good for you, not what you’re good at. The work and success of the characters ultimately was not worth their lives. Likewise, in our lives we should focus on doing what we want to do, what we think is good for us. If what you’re good at and what’s good for you are the same thing then that’s great, but you should never cling to something beneficial if it turns into something that’s not.

## Is there a distinction between art and its artist?

The plot of the film revolves around the consequences when Morf, his girlfriend Josephina and Rhodora deny the requests of the recently deceased Vetril Dease and instead sell his artwork as if he was still alive and consenting. The film discusses something applicable in our lives based on how we ourselves approach art, both written and visual. Vetril Dease in the film could not be separated from his artworks, both literally because he used his own blood as paint and metaphorically because his evilness is stored within the paintings that haunt the trio who stole his work. The film takes the stance that the art cannot be separated from the artist and this holds true. The personal nature of creating art ultimately results in a somewhat personal connection with the art. This is important to remember as we often forget when we’re reading that someone put work and effort into this, regardless of what we ultimately think of it. It’s a refreshing reminder to respect and appreciate the books we read and all the other forms of art we encounter in life.

## Wrapping Up

Velvet Buzzsaw may just be a rather niche, B-grade horror and satire film but it performs this role so well that the core values of the film are clear. From watching the film, we are left with the ideas of scepticism towards the critics in favour of our own opinions, doing what we love and is in our best interest and having a greater appreciation and respect for the work done by other writers and creators
