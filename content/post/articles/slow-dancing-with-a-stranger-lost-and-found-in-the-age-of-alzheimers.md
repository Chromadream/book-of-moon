**Book Title**: Slow Dancing with a Stranger: Lost and Found in the Age of Alzheimer’s.

**Author**: Meryl Comer

**Walk with me for when the sun rises, we may not remember**

“Nothing I do is really about me ; it’s all about making sure no one ends up like me” said Meryl Comer in her heart-wrenching and profoundly personal memoir as she casts a light on Alzheimer’s and the challenges she went through with her husband, who battled the disease. Here is a little rundown on Alzheimer’s and what exactly the disease entails:

* Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that’s starts off slowly and gradually worsens over time.
* Those suffering from Alzheimer’s experience memory loss that aggravates, disorientation, mood swings, speech impairment, behavioral changes and lack in an ability to self-care.
* 70% of the risk is believed to be through genetics, while the rest includes a history of possible head injuries, depression and hypertension.
* By 2015, 29.8 million people were diagnosed with AD worldwide and resulted in the death of 1.9 million people.
* Unfortunately there is no treatment that could be done to prevent its progression and is considered a terminal illness.

Meryl Comer an Emmy award-winning broadcast journalist and leading Alzheimer’s advocate provides a much needed wake-up call and eye opener to understand this affliction better and address its implications.

## What is Alzheimer's?

It is generally said that as people grow old their behavior becomes similar to that of a child, and people with Alzheimer’s have a behavior similar to that of an infant. Which may as well be ten times harder. The effect that this devastating condition has on the victim and their caregiver is harrowing.

## The silver lining.

You end up making so many mistakes, so many breakthroughs; you have good days and bad days and days worse than those. Hell, it probably will push you to rock bottom. However, the thing about rock bottom is that you’ve got nowhere else to go but up. Buried deep in the revelations of this memoir, is a love story. You see pain, heartbreak, victory and happiness.

As someone who has seen a very close relative of mine suffer from Alzheimer’s, it’s not something that you can wake up one day and hope they remember everything, pursue the rest of their life without any help. We all hope they do, but the disease is relentless and so should we be.

## Wrap Up

Take a little bit time out of your day to check in on your health, talk to your friends, family, and ask them how their day went. Let them tell you stories, let them distract you – even if it only lasts a minute- from the harsh reality that the world is in today. Meryl Comer and her husband Harvey Gralnick were just one among several to have been through this devastating path. Let’s put aside the whole mentality of “He/she is old, no wonder they keep forgetting everything”. It’s about time we use what we have to help others.

That being said, on a lighter note: your significant other forgetting your birthday is a whole another story for a whole another day.
