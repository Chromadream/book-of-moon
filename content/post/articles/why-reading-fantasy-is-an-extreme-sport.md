A friend recently said to me, “There is nothing more comforting than a good fantasy novel.” At the time I didn’t think much of it, in fact I was inclined to agree with them. But the more I think about it the less I agree.

## Purpose.

A fantasy novel’s purpose is to transport the reader to a different world. Let the reader live through the eyes of another, a life full of action and adventure, not comfort. A good fantasy novel can set pulses racing, adrenaline pumping and even tears falling, it’s basically an assault to your emotions. I think the genre of fantasy does this so easily as it’s often a whole new scenario, like culture shock in a book. And because you can’t relate to the world around you, you relate to the familiar emotions of the protagonist. And therefore are far more attached when a favourite character dies, or a new relationship blossoms.

## Fandoms?

But why is it that the genre of fantasy has so many fandoms, events like Comic Con and re-enactment societies? I was recently in New Zealand and hiking through the forest I stumbled upon a group of people re-enacting a Lord of the Rings fight scene. I had respect for them, it was well done. They were head to toe in costumes, weapons and a few even had elf ears on. Feeling a bit like an interloper, I backed away lest one of them shot me with an arrow.

But now thinking back, these people weren’t looking for comfort, they were looking for excitement, adventure. And so made a story their reality. For most people, you close the book and back to real life. The fight scene you’d read about, though adrenaline spiking, subsides the moment you put the book down and go about your life. But for many I think putting the book down is a difficult feat. We’ve all been there: its 3am you have to be up for an 8am tutorial but you just can’t seem to put the book down. “Just one more chapter” you tell yourself over and over until the sun comes up and you’ve finished the book.

## What Fantasy Meant For Me.

For me personally, I’m sure I’m a nightmare to be around when I read a fantasy novel. The rest of my life is kind of put on hold until I finish the book. I’m not productive at all, and I should probably apologise to my housemates now for the lack of household jobs that get done, conversations I’m not 100% listening to, and shutting myself in my room with my book.

This is why reading fantasy novels is an extreme sport. It’s hard work. Not the reading part, that’s too easy. It’s the coming back to reality part that requires discipline, willpower and practice. And so, toeing that line between reality and fantasy is an achievement, one I think avid fantasy readers should be more recognised for.
