The idea of picking up a book might turn off young people, especially in this age of digital content. With our short attention spans, we just want something short and effortless to give us that instant gratification. Of course, there are benefits to the internet, it allows us to constantly stay up-to-date with the latest news but little do we know that most hidden gem can also be found by reading a hardback or an e-book! 

## HOW TO MAKE READING INTERESTING

Think of yourself going to the gym for the first time. You might feel excited at first, but if you don’t set any goals or see immediate results over time you’ll quickly lose motivation.

Interestingly, this applies to reading as well! You’re so excited you bought that book with that appealing cover. Not even halfway through the book, you left it as a book stand or leave it quietly in the bookshelves.

How do you stay focus in reading? SIMPLE! You just need to set yourself 3 realistic goals.

* Turn your PHONE OFF!

This is by far the biggest distraction - with buzzing notifications from Facebook or Youtube will easily divert your attention away. Try turning your phone off for a few hours a day, and spend some alone time with a book.

* Read Chapter by Chapter!

Chapters are there for a reason. You don’t want to cram your brain and pressure yourself into quickly finishing a book. If you’re reading a self-help or non-fiction book (think 7 Habits, or the history of the Soviet Union), don’t feel bad for skipping a few chapters. Always remember, quality beats quantity. Enjoyment comes first.  

* Give yourself mini-breaks

Pause every 15 minutes and try to summarise what you’ve read so far. For example, if it’s a self-help guide you’re reading, ask yourself, “What new things have I learned? What have been the biggest 1 or 2 takeaways so far?”.
Or, if it’s a murder mystery, ask yourself, “Who are currently the most likely suspects, and how would they have committed the murder? Has the author left any hints about the killer’s identity?”
By summarising what you’ve just read into a few bullet points, you keep track of where you are in the book and this allows for better engagement with the story.

## Wrap up

Once you get into the zone and develop a habit, reading will become an addiction. All it takes is just discipline and consistency, and most importantly develop a love for act of reading.
