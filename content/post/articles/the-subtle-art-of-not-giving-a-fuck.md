Despite the gimmicky title, this “counterintuitive approach to living a good life” does precisely what is promised. Personally for me, this book came along at just the right time. It was a parting gift from my brother when he moved states. In the absence of his sage advice this book has formed a lot of my more recent decisions and I would like to think I am the happier for it.

## Why this book is special

Just like one of his key arguments, Mark Manson cuts the bullshit and gets straight to the point. I can appreciate the direct approach. Most books that try to teach me how to live my life just annoy me and I rarely make it past the first few chapters. But this one was different.

Manson demonstrates his abundant research through the analysis of the life and works of Charles Bukowski (coincidentally one of my favourite poets), the teachings of Buddhism, existentialist thought, and narratives of his own life. Manson really covers all bases when looking for ways to discredit him. Whether your thing is logic and math equations, or psychology and biology he uses all forums to support his claims.

## Obtaining happiness from within.

Perhaps this book struck such a chord with me as it can be drawn on from any book situated on my bookshelf. After reading Manson’s work, all its neighbours on my shelf seem to be telling me the same things. John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath, Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment, Thoreau’s Walden; all of these books are now read with an analysis of the suffering of the protagonist, their dissatisfaction and unease necessary for the creation of consistent happiness. To be able to obtain it, they had to do something about it.

## Laugh out loud.

Not to scare you off, the book doesn’t get too heavy. Manson’s truths being dispersed with funny anecdotes and satirical humour make the pessimistic outlook seem not so dark and scary. Also the simple style in which it is written allows for those of us who like to pick up a book and simply read it, rather than having to analyse every sentence to determine the true meaning, to do just that.

## Personal Thoughts

Manson will tell you all the things you don’t want to hear about yourself. But if you take his advice, and accept pain in any form, for what it is (the body’s most effective means of spurring action) and actually do something, you stand a chance of being happy for the long term.

If you’re looking for a refreshing take on a self – help book, intrigued by the title, or just want to read a book recommended by Chris Hemsworth, this book is definitely worth the read.
