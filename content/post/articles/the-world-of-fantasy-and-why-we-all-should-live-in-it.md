# A Master Story Teller

Brandon Sanderson is, perhaps, the most renowned contemporary name in the literary genre of Fantasy (I say contemporary because the title of the undisputed champion will always belong to J.R.R Tolkien—the man who invented the genre of Fantasy through his elite work: The Lord of the Rings).

Sanderson remains a master story teller, however, and he not only penned works like Mistborn, but was given the privilege of finishing the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan—considered to be a legendary work of Fantasy since 1990—after Jordan’s death.

Yes. It can, and did, in the case of Robert Jordan. And when we dread authors dying before completing their books, the first person we all probably thought of was…

Let us pray that God gives Martin enough life expectancy to leave us with the knowledge of the rightful Ruler of the Seven Kingdoms finally getting their throne.

Mercifully, Sanderson was selected as the successor to Jordan and, while I myself haven’t finished the Wheel of Time series, fans say he not only lived up to Jordan’s legacy, but actually enhanced it.

# The World of Fantasy

Recently I had finished reading Sanderson’s The Way of Kings.

The reason why I enjoy Fantasy so much is because it’s a different world that you can fly to. And every book brings a new type of world. Perhaps for this very same reason I don’t usually read non-fiction. Mankind and this planet are known, familiar, and predictable for us and that is why we continue to search for life outside the planet.

The word I have been waiting to use is **escapism**. Escapism is a necessary quality found in Fantasy readers and is what differentiates them from other genre readers. The Earth, and perhaps this universe, is not enough for a Fantasy reader—he or she wants to know about the things which don’t exist or haven’t yet been discovered.

No! That’s science-fiction. Don’t confuse the two.

### But just in case you are confused;

To entertain you a bit with the important difference between the two genres: science-fiction plays with the existing dimensions of this world. Science fiction relates to ‘science’, that is, what we already know, and enhances it using pseudo-scientific ways, that is, what we haven’t yet done with what we already know.

Fantasy is anything but science. Fantasy is the opposite of science. Fantasy is unbounded by the laws of the universe, effectively resulting in unbounded imagination and, by extension, endless entertainment.

# An Underrated—and often misunderstood—genre

I am not usually an overly informal writer, especially while I’m in the process of reviewing books, however, I feel that a ripened imagination is a quirk many people lack these days.

I wrote this piece as a declaration that reading is not always necessarily about being informed. The greatest part of being a reader is the desire to escape to another realm, richly constructed of pure creativity. Dragons, swords, kingdoms, magic, and sorcery are but a small part of the genre. The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern is exemplary of a Fantasy book, focusing on two circus magicians, that is nearly poetic in its story, writing, and romance. Famous classics like The Brothers Grimm, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Princess Bride, A Christmas Carol, and Lord of the Rings (second time I’m mentioning it, I know) are all Fantasy books. And we’ve met Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz and The Chronicles of Narnia with the help of school and Disney.

Nothing can offer a reader more massive and diverse realms than Fantasy stories. ‘Stories’ in the truest sense.

# To Conclude

I believe that every child grows up watching, reading, and learning about fantastical things. There is no reason for an adult to discontinue that entertainment.

I have decided to end this piece by leaving a handful of recommendations, however, nothing ventured, nothing gained, and the only way to explore this expansive and wondrous part of literature is by yourself.

1. Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson (trilogy)
2. Malazan series by Steven Erikson (series)
3. The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern (standalone)
4. Elantris by Brandon Sanderson (short standalone)
5. Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling (yes, it’s Fantasy, and I don’t know who, but someone needed to see this)
