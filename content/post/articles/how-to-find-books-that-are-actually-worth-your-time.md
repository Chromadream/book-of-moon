*“If you don’t like to read, you haven’t found the right book.”*

― J.K Rowling

One of the most interesting questions I’ve been asked by people I know is “Hey you know books right? What books would you recommend me?“
To be honest it ultimately depends on each individual. If you want to get entertained, than I highly recommend reading a fiction book. If your goal is to gain knowledge, then personal development might be for you. If you’re want to understand the mechanisms of romantic life, then pick up a book about dating!

Personally, I am interested in human psychology and I found that the authors Malcolm Gladwell, Daniel Kahneman, and Simon Sinek have taught me valuable lessons. I have no background in this field, and yet I found their works easy to understand and enjoy.

## How to determine a great Book or Author

Sometimes, finding a great book or author can be difficult, like finding the unheard restaurant with extraordinary cuisine. I was fortunate enough to found these high caliber authors while browsing the library and asking the librarian for his recommendations on introductory books on psychology.

* Ask someone knowledgeable in the genre you’re interested in, and ask them for recommendations. This person could be a librarian, but it could also be a friend or a colleague.

* Attend a local book club or meetup. This is especially useful if none of your friends read books, or if you just want to meet new people with similar interests.

* Pick up a book from a list of top sellers from goodreads, or just your local bookstore. Good books are usually popular for a reason, and you probably can’t go wrong with any of the top 10 reads of the month. Of course, this isn’t always the case (think 50 Shades of Grey or the Da Vinci Code).

* Pick up a book lauded by the experts as the best in its class. Looking amongst award-winning books or authors isn’t a bad way to start your search. Goodreads, for example, presents annual awards for their best picks of the year, over a variety of genres and topics.
