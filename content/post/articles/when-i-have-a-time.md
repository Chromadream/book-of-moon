We all have a when-I-have-time-book which is extremely large and heavy, it sits on your
shelf for years, and you scare yourself out of reading them, and the more it sits there, the
more it taunts you with its unread pages, characters, and unknown narrative…
My *When-I-Have-Time-books* is Anna Karenina.

## Flashback.

I bought it when I was 15, a beautiful paperback cover, from a QBD from a local shopping
centre – I didn’t start it straight away because in my small hands it had to be carried with
both. I promised myself I would read it when I was older…
And here we are, I’m almost 23, and 668 pages into Anna Karenina.
7 years on, the book is still large and overwhelming (to my still small hands), heavy, and
indicative to the sit-down-read style of enjoying literature. Upon starting this novel, I had to
adjust to the idea of not taking this book larger than the bible, on the train, in a car, on a bus,
or in my bag, like every other book. Which was an overall strange experience, like accidently
leaving your chap stick at home, not imperative to your daily experience, but it’s presence is
very much valued.
The engagement process with Anna Karenina involves a comfy space, and every creature
comfort for a long sit; beverage(s), chocolate, a phone, and a window to stare out of for
narrative/character contemplation. I’ve got to say, after a few weeks (I admit, very slow
reader over here) it’s become such a pleasurable reading experience. Which is a stark
difference to novels I’ve read in the past – that happen so fast, in many different reading environments, it’s over before you know it.

## Contrast.

Because of the slow-moving narrative, which primarily focuses on inter and intra-personal
relationships of a variety of characters, the descriptive language employed by Tolstoy creates
a slowness that creates a clear contrast with pace of daily modern life, therein allowing a
space of pause from the 21 st century to a time when communication with others was either in
person or by letter or telegram. Chapters describe long days and nights spent in fields
focusing on peasant work, or the early mornings spent hunting small game in regional areas
of Pre-industrial Russia, The story becomes an expression of Tolstoy’s love for his diverse
country.

## Drivers.

The plot drivers are extremely subtle and feel almost like a pre-industrial Days of Our Lives
episode, where characters are connected to each other by loose connections via family,
acquaintances, or occupying the same space. But this elaborate web of characters is spun with
such nuance and care and doesn’t seem so complex until you attempt to describe the plot to
others. The storyline of Anna Karenina becomes a lengthy description of the web and each
character’s crisis and why the characters are in their confounding positions.
Tolstoy’s ability to expand and contract time in narrative is phenomenal, it’s an inversion of
the traditional climax-resolution narrative structure. Tolstoy expands small moments and
character introspections through multiple different settings, and time periods. This diverse
range of moment expansion is a direct rejection of Aristotles ideas of Classical Unities
(where the stories occurs in a short time period with a small amount of characters in a
minimal set of locations). The result is a complex web of character climaxes with others,
environments, and themselves. At this point of my reading, the characters feel so real and
authentic that they tantalized Tolstoy to continue to (for me) an unforeseeable end.

## Final Thoughts

This book has so far changed my reading style, stopped me from assuming endings of books
and enjoy the ride Tolstoy is buckling me into, and made all my other When-I-Have-Time
books seem less daunting, because this stories like these, I want to make time for these
narratives.
