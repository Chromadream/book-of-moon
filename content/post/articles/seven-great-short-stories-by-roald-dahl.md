## Roald Dahl

Roald Dahl is arguably one of the most prolific children’s authors of all time, and undoubtedly one of the most successful authors of all time. A household name across the English-speaking world and beyond, even those who have never read his stories (of which there are few) are probably familiar with most of his popular works. Whether it be “Matilda”, “James and the Giant Peach” or his most famous story “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” (all of which have since been adapted for the big screen) his stories all share one thing in common - a selection of wild, colourful characters which bring light to an otherwise depressing world run by adults.

## Growing up reading his books.

As a child growing up in the 00’s, I was introduced to these books by relatives and teachers at school. These stories regularly bordered on the absurd and the downright surreal, but never crossed into the realm of the frightening or freakish. There was a innocent, slapstick quality to his characters - think Willy Wonka, or the Big Friendly Giant -  as as a nine year-old, I found that comforting.

As I grew into my adolescence, however, I soon left these stories behind in search of more “grown-up” books. The world of Roald Dahl faded away into my memory, until I inevitably stumbled upon and was reintroduced to Dahl through his lesser-known short stories. Originally intended for adult and teenage audiences, these short tales (some only a few pages long) could be said to have shared nothing at all with his children’s stories.
In these 7 short stories, Dahl employs outlandish characters and absurd situations to shock, frighten and entertain.

## A Piece of Cake (1942)

Starting this list with his first published story, A Piece of Cake was a originally a magazine piece for the Saturday Evening Post, written during the midst of Britain’s North African campaign in World War 2. A (mostly) real account of his experience as an RAF pilot flying Gloster Gladiators over the Middle East, Dahl wrote the story give the public a taste of life working arguably the most dangerous job of the war.

Dahl’s first foray into the world of writing mixes elements of reality and the surreal as he recounts not only war-time events, but also describes in detail his lucid memories as he passed in and out of consciousness following a near-fatal crash landing. It was this first article which started Dahl’s writing career, encouraged by prominent novelist C.S. Forester who first recognised his talent as a writer. This story is a must read for any fan of Dahl and a stark departure from the fiction that we’ve come to know him for.

## Beware of the Dog (1942)

Two years after his first publication with A Piece of Cake, Dahl wrote Beware of the Dog, an entirely fictional story of an RAF pilot who finds himself in an unusual hospital ward after crashing his plane over Europe. While the parallels to real life events are clear, the story deviates from reality when our hero begins to suspect that the hospital staff are not who they really claim to be. Dahl would go on to write more WW2 themed stories and more heart-felt pieces such as Katina, using his own experiences as a base for more creative fiction.

## The Wish

My favourite Roald Dahl short story, and one of my favourite short stories of all time, his little known tale extends to only a 2 pages. The premise is exceedingly simple: a young boy left alone at home plays his own version of “the floor-is-lava”. What draws me to this story is the reflection I see of my own childhood, being forced to exercise one’s imagination to pass the time on those long, boring afternoons at home.

Most have interpreted the story’s ending as a sinister twist on an innocent play-game, though I like to think Dahl deliberately left the ending ambiguous - leaving the reader to determine the boy’s fate. Do the boy’s imaginings come to life to consume him, or is it all just a figment of his over-active imagination? Regardless of how you may interpret it, Dahl succeeds in drawing the reader into a reality invented by a small boy with a big imagination.

## Skin (1952)

A sinister tale of greed and naivety, Skin is not a story most people would associate with the author of “The BFG”. Then again, these same people probably didn’t know Dahl was a frequent writer for PlayBoy magazine, but that’s an article for another day. Dahl’s fascination with the macabre is reflected in many of his short stories, and Skin is probably one of the best examples of this. 
The premise of the story is rather complicated. A old man who owns a priceless work of art is offered a tantalising reward for its sale. The only problem? The artwork is a tattoo piece encompassing his entire back, and those bidding for its purchase have some unconventional ideas for its exhibition.

## The LandLady (1959)

One of his better known short stories, The LandLady is an unsettling horror short written for The New Yorker in 1960. A young man is searching for lodging in a new town, and stumbles across a bed and breakfast owned by a friendly and seemingly harmless old lady. However, as he and the reader gradually discover, all isn’t as it seems. As with his other stories, Dahl avoids using scenes of graphic or explicit violence to frighten his audience. Instead he relies on subtle hints scattered throughout the story, letting the reader to make up their mind as to what really happens.

## Royal Jelly (1983)

The last horror story on this list, Royal Jelly (published in the Twilight Zone Magazine) is one of the few Dahl stories that explores elements of science-fiction. For those of you who don’t keep bees, royal jelly is a substance secreted by a queen bee which is fed to all larvae, a necessary ingredient to the growth of a hive. Widely lauded by the alternative medicine community as a solution for various health ailments (but dismissed by the mainstream health), Dahl toys with the idea that perhaps the effects of taking royal jelly are far more pronounced than anyone could ever imagine.

The story follows a beekeeper and his wife struggling to feed their baby daughter, a skinny child who rejects any form of milk. As they struggle to answer this mystery, the desperate father looks to his beekeeping knowledge for a solution and very quickly, the root of the mystery is revealed. This is a horror perhaps most deeply felt by those who have experienced the difficulties of early parenthood, especially when considering Dahl’s first child passed away of measles at a very young age.

## Galloping Foxley (1953)

We’ve all been in this situation - we’re out in public minding our own business when we happen upon someone from our past, someone we haven’t seen in a very long time. Whether it be a forgotten friend from childhood, a partner from a bygone relationship, or an old workplace colleague, it’s can oftentimes be an awkward situation to find yourself in.

In the final story on this list, a man on a train thinks he recognises someone from his childhood, although he can’t be certain. As he tries piece together the puzzle, the uncomfortable memories flood back. Dahl, who suffered terrible torment at the hands of prefects (senior students wielding authority) during his days at boarding school, fills much of this story with elements of his real childhood. In this semi-biographical story, Dahl reminds us that sometimes the past, no matter how painful, is best left forgotten.

## Wrap Up

I hope these 7 short stories serve to illustrate the broad range of Dahl's literacy skills and the variety of genres touched upon throughout his career. While his children's stories will remain his greatest achievements, it's important his lesser known works also share in the spotlight. In doing so, they add further credibility to his reputation and offer a glimpse into the life of this extraordinary creator.
