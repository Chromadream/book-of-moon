Everyone has heard the word “author” and immediately pictured
some poor soul locked away in a dark room while their fingers tap, tap,
tap away on their way to a good story. They don’t get the same
recognition that actors who portray their characters do; movies can be
made as a result of their books, but how many of us can say we even
know what Suzanne Collins or J.K. Rowling even look like? They aren’t
followed in the media the same way actors who portray their characters
are. They’re just locked away in the dark room we imagine for them, living
their lives through a keyboard. But what if they had lives as intricate and
detailed as the beloved characters they’ve created for readers across the
globe? What if they aren’t the faceless names we so often think of,
merely associating their appearance with the font their name is in on the
covers of our favourite books? If you’ve never even considered this
option, buckle up and brace yourself: bestselling author Fiona McIntosh
proves us wrong with each and every event she hosts and attends.

From arguments with her editor to stories of twisted underwear,
Fiona holds her audience in the palm of her hand whenever she has the
stage. The crowd of women both young and old laugh unapologetically
and sighed empathetically throughout her stories, while the few men in
the crowd tried their best to remain stone-faced so as not to seem too
soft in the eyes of their partners. After all, as Fiona pointed out, what man
would be caught dead reading a gooey romance novel that their wife
brought home? Most men wouldn’t look her in the eye following this
comment. We all knew she’d caught them out. They tried (and failed) to
deny their wives the gleeful satisfaction of knowing their husbands’ guilty
pleasure was a good ol’ fashioned tale of love and betrayal.

However, while her writing is mysterious, romanticised, and eloquent,
her stories about her life of excitement and embarrassment are far from
delicate. With each word, she gives life to the name on each of her
books, and the crowd falls in love with the woman behind the stories.

“Do you all know I have underwear mishaps?” To the audience’s and
my own surprise, this is how Fiona begins the topic of how she met the
publishers of her latest novel, *The Pearl Thief*.

“You’re all looking very blankly at me. I share my underwear stories
with *everyone*,” Fiona continued.

“I could tell you millions, but I’m gonna tell you this one.” After we
finish laughing, Fiona continues to tell us about how *The Pearl Thief* was
bought by Penguin Publishing in Britain, and she consequently flew to
London to meet her future publishers. As she shares her presumptions of
what that meeting would entail, we all laugh uncontrollably with her. She
tells us how she’d felt so extravagant, as though she were the next big
thing.

“Stand aside, Harry Potter, whoever wrote that,” she declares with a
dismissive wave of her hand that causes an even louder wave of laughter
to sweep the room. She then tells us about the morning of her meeting.
Her family was asleep, it was four o’clock in the morning, and she had to
get dressed in the dark.

“Girls, *never* get dressed in the dark,” she quips. We smile back at
her, but no one dares to laugh, no one wants to miss a word of the story.
Finally, she tells us the worst of the story, an error only realised when
she’d arrived at Penguin headquarters. We sat in stunned silence as she
chose her words carefully, trying to explain her predicament delicately.

“I got out of the car, and as I got out of the car, I thought, “Oh! That
doesn’t feel very comfortable!”” she reflected.

“As I stepped out a little bit further, I realised what had happened.
Now, girls, you know your knickers look like this?” At this, Fiona waved
her hands around in a vaguely underwear-like shape. “Now, take your
knickers, turn them on the side ... and put them on. What’s gonna
happen to the business? The business is gonna go all the way over to
one side, and sit there in a lovely, ugly, lump.” She explains that while this
was a terrible situation in itself, she was also struggling with meeting her
new publishers whilst handling this predicament.

“I could just think, “vagina,””.

In sharing this tale of woe with her readers, she humanised her pen name
and broke the barrier that so often seems to separate authors from their
readership. She was no longer simply *Fiona McIntosh, the one who wrote The Pearl Thief*, but had evolved into *Fiona McIntosh, the author who isn’t afraid to tell it like it is.* With this transition, any reader who is lucky
enough to attend one of her events or even meet her in the street, will
begin to understand the incredible lives behind a simple pen name on a
beloved novel.
