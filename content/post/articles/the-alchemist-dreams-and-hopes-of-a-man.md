“It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.” 

― *Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist*

The Alchemist is one of the best fiction books I’ve read so far and I was truly mesmerized by the knowledge and life lessons that I learned from this work of fiction. This book is an absolute gem for anyone who striving towards some personal goal or ambition. 

The story begins with a young shepherd who dreams recurrently and comes to believe that his dream could be decipher. He begins to search his dreams whereupon he encounters people who help to solidify his perspectives toward himself as a person. He stumbles upon unique characters that influence his journey which includes fortune tellers, Kings, an Englishman, Fatima, and finally The Alchemist himself. Each of the characters have their own unique story and it is rewarding to read as the boy’s character progressively grows from the beginning till the end.

There are parts in the book which really hit me emotionally, where it felt like I had just gone through all the adversity that he confronted throughout his journey. Throughout the story, the boy is forced to make many sacrifices and difficult decisions in his journey toward achieving his dream. This book really taught me and helped me reflect that all things that happen in life happens for a reason. It has encouraged me to be more resilient during tough times and to take every opportunity in life as some opportunities don’t come twice.

## Wrap Up

This book is a must read for the casual fiction lover and for those people who want to fulfill their dreams. It is a classic timeless fiction worth reading every now and again.
