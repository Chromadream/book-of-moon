## Introduction

Like many young readers, I practiced reading by learning from classic fairy tales. My love of
classics didn’t stop there however, these stories sending me down a rabbit hole of classic
literature. For many people however, classical books are held, rather ironically, at an arm’s
length. Classical books often get a bad rap as only being read at the behest of an English
teacher or just for the sake of someone being able to say that they’ve read it (with *War and Peace* being such an example). Normal, everyday readers don’t typically walk into a
bookstore or search through eBooks with the intention of reading something from a
hundred or more years ago. One of the main reasons why many don’t do this is because of
the high pedestal upon which we place these books, falsely associating them with a degree
of difficulty beyond our own, normal understanding. We shouldn’t let the academics and
analysis scare us away from these classic tales however because there is so much to be
gained from reading these stories.

## Universal Themes

The reason why some classics stand the test of time and remain relevant is the universality
of the themes they often discuss. *The Picture of Dorian Gray* is about vanity and social
pressure, *The Great Gatsby* about poverty and hedonism. Without the settings attached, the
former being in Victorian England and the latter in the Roaring Twenties United States, a
similar version of these stories could be told today with the same effect. A new reader will
almost never struggle to relate to the story because they will, at the very least, have some
form of opinion regarding the theme of the book. A reader of Dorian Gray may not have any
knowledge or opinions about life in the 19 th century but they certainly will be able to relate

to Dorian’s vanity and obsession with his self-imagery. A universal theme connects readers
to these stories by making them relevant and important.

## Well Written

While arguing that classics are good because they are well-written may seem like a purely
academic argument, most classics are written in a way that the modern reader enjoys.
Charles Dicken’s *A Tale of Two Cities* begins with the famous lines, “It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times” and continues with a similar beat throughout its opening passage.
Content aside, the writing is pleasant; it follows a pattern and a double-sidedness that
readers can find satisfaction within. Reading stories that are well written are important for
our own personal development, as the language styles and readings we expose ourselves to
will inevitable affect our own. Many famous writers such as Stephen King argue that the
writers who will influence your own writing will be the ones you read the most. Reading well
written classics can therefore not only be enjoyable and pleasant but also beneficial to our
own mental capacities.

## They’re so different from our reality

While the use of universal themes may draw the old classic stories closer to our reality,
there are plenty of other stories and methods employed that keep from this connection
from getting too close, should our purpose for reading instead be escapism. The absurdity
of the classics either through the progress of time or their own satirical nature can provide
this valuable insight into a foreign world that isn’t our own anymore. Shakespeare’s works
are all set over 400 years ago, the worlds crafted by the Romantics are a whimsical dream.
Even *Macbeth*, a massively popular classic work that contains relevant themes of betrayal,
pride and greed, can be jarringly different from the reality we live in at times when we stop
to consider how entertaining some of the literary quibble employed by Shakespeare such as
the witches and MacDuff can ultimately be.

## Conclusion

Classic tales are often overlooked by readers for more modern works, reducing them to
being over-analysed by English teachers and academics alone. There are many benefits for
reading classic books and all readers should feel comfortable enough to be able to read
these books and enjoy them for what they often are; well-written, relatable tales that have
stood the test of time by always enticing readers back to them.
