I believe that everyone can appreciate a good horror novel once in a while.
Instead of going with the usual names, why don't we explore new names, especially the ones from the East?
This list contains three of the lesser known Japanese horror novels that I think you should read.

## 1. Parasite Eve (Hideaki Sena)

"Isn't that the PlayStation game?" maybe is the question that pops in your mind when I mentioned this title.
As a matter of fact, the franchise came from this novel, which doesn't have any connection with the game, besides the title.
The novel is a wonderful journey that surely will terrify you to the end.

## 2. Zoo (Otsuichi)

It's not strictly a novel, but more of a collection of short stories, doesn't make it less terrifying.
One of the stories talk about a person who received a picture of said person's decomposing partner.
If that doesn't terrify you, I don't know what will.

## 3. Another (Yukito Ayatsuji)

Most people knew about the anime adaptation, but the novel is a lot better and somehow is really underappreciated.
With the gruesome details and well-done pacing, the novel is actually a lot better than the anime.
It's a pity, really.
