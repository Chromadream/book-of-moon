If you're a fan of Stephen King, Anthony Horowitz or just enjoy an occasional short story, these 6 five-minute reads should provide all the entertainment you could wish for on those hot, boring afternoons. Mixing elements of the supernatural, science-fiction and the plain weird, I've chosen these stories as examples that showcase the creativity and imagination of today's online authors.
