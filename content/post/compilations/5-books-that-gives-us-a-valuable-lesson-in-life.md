## Wrapping things up

How can we use the lessons we learn to create something meaningful in life? As humans, we alone are responsible for creating change in this world, starting first with ourselves. We aren’t perfect, and there’s nothing we ever can do to change that. But we should nonetheless strive to improve ourselves every single day, learning to live our own personal flaws and those of others and in the process live happier, more fulfilling lives.
