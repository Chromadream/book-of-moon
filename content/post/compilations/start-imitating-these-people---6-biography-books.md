## Wrapping things up

Biographies are a great way to learn about and understand great people. Unfortunately, many people have the notion that biographies are boring, however, I believe reading biographies written by a great author can be an emotional roller coaster ride. My take-away from these 4 books is that it isn’t the destination which matters most, but the journey that takes you there and how you choose to navigate the obstacles that life throws in your path.
