## All the Devils are Here (2010) – Bethany McLean

*Penguin Books, 416 Pages.*

Financial journalist Bethany McLean came to media attention in 2001 when she published in Vanity Fair an article titled “Is Enron Overpriced?”. Months later, the energy giant collapsed – at the time the largest bankruptcy the world had known – and subsequently exposed to the world one of the worst cases of accounting fraud in US history. Two years later her recount of the scandal, The Smartest Guys in the Room, became a best-seller and was later adapted into a film.

All the Devils are Here is an intricate yet accessible look into the 2008 global financial crisis, the parties involved, the events leading up to the crash and its immediate repercussions. Taking perspectives from multiple accounts, the book looks into the 11 major figures and organisations which each played an important role in the meltdown.

This is a great read for anyone who enjoyed reading The Big Short or is just interested in the GFC, but is curious to learn more about all the actors involved. A cautionary tale which warns of the dangers of herd mentality, ineffective governance and greed.

Published in 2014, Flash Boys follows the journey of Brad Katsuyama, a Canadian stock trader who discovers a hidden flaw in the US stock trading system. As he tries to figure out what’s happening, he inevitably stumbles into the world of high frequency trading. There, he discovers that the stock market is not entirely what it appears to be or indeed what it once was, and tries to restore balance to a system at the very heart of the US economy.
Full of wit and humour, the book offers an insight into the failings of Wall Street culture, the disruption of technology on financial markets and a character study of those who choose to enter this field of work. Written for all audiences, even those with a limited understanding of the stock market should find this book an enjoyable read.

## The Bean Counters (2018) – Richard Brooks

*Atlantic Books, 336 Pages.*

Deloitte, PwC, EY and KPMG. These four firms represent the aspirations of almost every accounting student in the world, and yet they have each come a long way from their “bean-counting” beginnings. Consulting and financial advisory services now consist the majority of their business, and this raises a question. How can we expect the “big four” to police the balance sheets of big corporations, while also receiving big sums from these same companies who buy their consulting services?

The book takes a look into the history of these companies and the conflicts of interest that emerge, pointing specifically to former giant Arthur Anderson and its role in the Enron scandal. Whether or not you agree with the book’s conclusions, it’s worth reading if you’ve ever considered applying for a job at one of these four establishments.
