As a website run by students for students, Book of Moons seeks to celebrate and encourage a love for all things books, film and television - basically any type of story-telling which excites and inspires us. As a platform for student writers and bookworms, we aim to provide content to help guide you with your next book or movie purchase - regardless of whether you're a hardcore paperback lover or just a casual theatre-goer.
