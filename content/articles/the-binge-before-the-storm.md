One more year.

One more month.

One more week.

One more day.

Countdowns such as this exist in the lead up to many exciting events. Your next birthday, that
concert you’re dying to go to, a close friend coming to visit. Sometimes, a countdown surrounds
the next instalment of a series, be it books, movies, or TV. The latter of these often leads to a fastpaced review of the previous seasons of the unfinished story. With the upcoming premiere of the final season of HBO’s Game of Thrones, it would reasonable to assume the clash of swords,
pouring of wine, and the roar of dragons is, once again, taking over the screens of the modern
world. It has already been well over a year since the final episode of season seven; even my own TV depicts a daily re-play of the previous seasons. It’s been just over a week since I restarted the show, and I’ve already made it to season five (again).

I’d be lying if I said reading on wouldn’t give away parts of the series, so I wouldn’t recommend
following through with this piece. In the wise words of House Bookworm: Spoilers are coming.

## Binge watching this series.

I’d also be lying if I said I hadn’t binge-watched the show before, in preparation for other seasons.However, watching it again in preparation for the final season has an air of finality to it. Lands are conquered for the last time, kings are betrayed by their queens for the last time, our beloved characters fall for the last time. I am no longer finding myself questioning the possibility of a character somehow reappearing later in the show. I’ve become accustomed to the heartbreak of seeing Ned Stark’s head fall from his shoulders, the ever-decreasing hatred of Jamie Lannister, the sense of dread that creeps into my stomach at the sight of white walkers. I notice the finer details of the show, such as Olenna Tyrell taking a bead from Sansa’s necklace at Joffrey’s  wedding or Samwell Tarly’s statement that Jon “always comes back” a few episodes before his return from the grave.

## Is not what you think.

However, a marathon of the seven previous seasons does not only lead to a refreshed
understanding of the world of Westeros; the world of Westeros ensnares you in its grasp, and you soon find yourself absorbed in the fates of its characters. It is all-consuming. I find myself unable to drag myself away from its story. Season five is playing as I write this article. I cannot escape it, nor do I want to. I do not want to accept the end of a series that has been a part of my life for so long, both in books and on screens.

## Final Thoughts

I have grown to love the unknown element that surrounds each storyline within the series. It is a
vicious analogy of mankind’s past (with a few extra dragons to sweeten the tale). Unlike so many other TV series I have watched and enjoyed, the events in Game of Thrones cannot be predicted. You can never truly know how each episode will end, you can never hope to know of a character’s fate. It is as unpredictable as our own world, and that is why it is so well-loved by so many. Just as we cannot prepare for the death of so many important players in the game for the iron throne, we cannot truly prepare for what the final episode of the upcoming season will bring. The world is not ready to say goodbye to Westeros, but apparently it’s ready to say goodbye to us.
